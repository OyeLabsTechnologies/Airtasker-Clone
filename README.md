# Airtasker Clone ‚Äì MoonService by Oyelabs  

MoonService by Oyelabs gives you the power to [launch your own Airtasker-like marketplace](https://oyelabs.com/airtasker-clone/) where people can post tasks and get them done by nearby skilled providers. From assembling furniture to helping with a garden project, MoonService makes connecting people and getting jobs done simple and secure.  

***MOONSERVICE ‚Äì Create Your Community-Powered Task Marketplace***  

Unlike traditional service booking apps, an Airtasker-like model is **community-driven**, customers post their tasks, set a budget, and service providers make offers.
